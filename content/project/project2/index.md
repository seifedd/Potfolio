Classification of human voice, acquisition of samples of 4-6s.
Designed patterns to distinguish normal voice from many different common speech disorders such as stuttering

Performed pitch estimation and analysis of basic features of the speech signal. Speech recordings in wav audio format with 20 KHz sampling rate.
